= RHQ.next Inventory Experiments

This is a repository for experiments with the inventory for RHQ.next.

Initially, I only use this for the apiary.io blueprint of the REST API.

Other code might land here in the future but everything will be highly
experimental, not even POC-level quality.

The REST API documentation and mock server rendered from the apiary.apib file is accessible here:
http://docs.rhqnextinventory.apiary.io/

You can comment on the API right there.
